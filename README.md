# Problem Solved By Application

* myDoppel is an entertainment application allowing users to have fun finding their face match from a range of actor photos from popular TV shows.

* In addition, the application successfully combines the face-api.js package with image fetching from an open-source API. Upon fetching an array of images, the application runs a comparison function between a given user reference image and the actor image.
